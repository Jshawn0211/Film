‚ÄúHi [client name]

Just want to say again what a pleasure it was to work with you on [project name]. You really were a cool bunch of people to work around and it seems like everyone had a blast.

I was wondering if I could ask you for little summing up of everything that we‚Äôve done together. It only needs to be a few sentences max. We‚Äôll use it in our marketing materials and on our website, if that‚Äôs cool with you?

We look forward to working with you again.

And if you ever come across anyone needing our services, just drop them our details. We‚Äôd be delighted!

Kind regards,

[your name] on behalf of [your video business company]‚Äù
