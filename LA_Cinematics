We look forward to working with you again.

Jason is a Cybersecurity Engineer based in Los Angeles. He handles the "techy side of things". He is currently filming, photographing, and documenting his life one step at a time. Creating wedding films is something he has been happy to get into. Being in a relationship for 9+ years, Jason has realized how much more he wishes he would have captured digitally. He now is looking to help capture other people's lives so that they do not miss any of life's valuable moments.


# Videos to create
1. Business Intro
Promote your business on YouTube with a custom-made business intro video. Describe in detail what type of business you are and give some background info.
Clearly display your company logo and accompanying tagline at some point in the video so viewers can make an association with your brand.
