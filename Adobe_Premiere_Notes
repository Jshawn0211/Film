# Frame Rate shooting
###
- always have a plan when shooting
- know why you are filming in a certain FPS and resolution
1. Shoot in 24 fps when you have audio you are talking to and you dont want to slow down the footage
2. no audio shoot in 30 fps and play back at 24 fps makes footage look dreamy
3. shoot in 60 or 120 for slo mo
4. if you pick a 30 fps sequence do not add a 24 fps shot to it. (dont add smaller frame rates to a sequence of higher frame rates)
